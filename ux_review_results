## Executive Summary

Epic 1, Story 4 successfully implements the Edit MCP functionality with strong adherence to terminal UI best practices and user experience principles. The implementation demonstrates exceptional consistency with established patterns while introducing intuitive editing workflows that enhance the overall user experience.

**Overall UX Score: 92/100 (Excellent)**

### Key Strengths
- **Seamless Modal Integration**: Edit functionality reuses existing modal system with consistent visual and interaction patterns
- **Intelligent Form Pre-population**: All MCP types correctly populate existing data, reducing user effort and errors
- **Clear Edit Context**: Modal titles dynamically display MCP name being edited, providing clear context
- **Robust Cancellation**: ESC key handling maintains expected behavior with proper state cleanup
- **Type-Specific Validation**: Smart validation that allows current MCP name while preventing duplicates

### Areas for Enhancement
- **Visual Edit Indicators**: Consider adding visual cues to distinguish edit vs. add modes beyond modal title
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: No quick access to commonly edited fields (e.g., keyboard shortcut to jump to specific field)
- **Progress Feedback**: Limited visual feedback during save operations
- **Field Help Text**: Environment variable format guidance could be more prominent
