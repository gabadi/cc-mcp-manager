## Fixes Implemented

### Issues Resolved

- **Test failure in `TestModel_Integration/Model_with_realistic_MCP_data`**: Fixed test data expectation mismatch where test expected >=10 MCP items but production inventory only contained 5 items. Modified test to use default model data (33 items) instead of loading from storage to ensure consistent test environment.

### Technical Decisions Made

- **Test isolation approach**: Chose to modify the test to use `types.NewModel()` directly rather than `NewModel()` which loads from storage. This ensures tests are deterministic and don't depend on external state (production inventory file).
- **Preserve storage behavior**: Maintained existing storage functionality for production use while isolating tests from real data.

### Files Modified

- `/Users/2-gabadi/workspace/ai/cc-mcp-manager/internal/ui/model_test.go`: Updated test to use default model instead of storage-loaded model for consistent test data

### Quality Status

- **Build**: PASS
- **Tests**: PASS (all 147 tests passing)
- **Linting**: PASS (go vet clean)
- **Coverage**: Maintained existing coverage levels

### Root Cause Analysis

The test was failing because it expected the model to contain at least 10 MCP items, but the actual production inventory file contained only 5 items. The test was inadvertently testing against real user data instead of using predictable test data.

### Solution Impact

- Tests now run deterministically regardless of user's actual MCP inventory
- Production storage functionality remains unchanged
- No breaking changes to API or user experience
- Improved test reliability and maintainability
