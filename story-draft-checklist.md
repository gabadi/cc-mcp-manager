## Validation Scoring

**Scoring:** Each section receives Pass/Fail based on criteria completion
- Basic Structure: ___/5 criteria
- User Story: ___/3 criteria  
- Business Context: ___/4 criteria
- Acceptance Criteria: ___/6 criteria
- Technical Requirements: ___/4 criteria
- Definition of Done: ___/4 criteria
- Dependencies & Risks: ___/4 criteria
- Test Strategy: ___/4 criteria
- Content Quality: ___/4 criteria
- BMAD Compliance: ___/4 criteria
- Development Readiness: ___/4 criteria

**Total Score: ___/42 criteria**

**Approval Threshold: 90% (38/42 criteria must pass)**

## Validation Results

### Overall Assessment
- [ ] **APPROVED** - Meets 90%+ threshold, ready for development
- [ ] **NEEDS_REVISION** - Below 90% threshold, requires improvements

### Critical Issues (if any)
- [ ] Missing or unclear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Insufficient business context
- [ ] Technical feasibility concerns
- [ ] Scope too large for single story
- [ ] Dependencies not properly addressed
- [ ] Test strategy inadequate

### Recommendations
- Address all failed criteria before development
- Focus on clarity and testability of acceptance criteria
- Ensure business value is clearly articulated
- Validate technical approach with architecture team
