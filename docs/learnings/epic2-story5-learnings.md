# Epic 2 Story 5 Learning Capture

## Story Context
- **Story**: Project Context Display
- **Status**: Review Complete - Approved (100% criteria met)
- **Agent Model**: BMAD story-simple workflow with Dev agent implementation
- **Test Coverage**: Excellent (100% test pass rate)

## Basic Learning Items

### Technical Implementation Patterns
- **Directory Monitoring**: 5-second polling pattern proved effective for real-time context updates without performance impact
- **Path Display Intelligence**: Home directory shortening and intelligent truncation patterns for UI space optimization
- **Status Enum Pattern**: SyncStatus enum with Unknown, InSync, OutOfSync, Error states provides clear state management
- **Footer Component Enhancement**: Priority-based display system for status bar components works well for multiple context items

### Go/TUI Development Learnings
- **Struct Design**: ProjectContext struct pattern with embedded time.Time and count fields enables clean state management
- **Service Layer Integration**: ClaudeService enhancement pattern maintains separation of concerns while adding context awareness
- **Model Update Patterns**: Real-time updates through established Model message patterns ensure UI consistency
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Directory path handling requires careful consideration for different OS path formats

### Testing Approach Success
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 85%+ coverage requirement with 100% pass rate demonstrates robust testing approach
- **Integration Testing**: Directory change detection tests validate real-world usage scenarios
- **Edge Case Handling**: Testing various project states (no MCPs, all active, directory changes) ensures reliability

## Improvement Suggestions

### Performance Optimization
- **Polling Frequency**: Consider adaptive polling based on user activity to reduce background processing
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement context caching for frequently accessed project information
- **Memory Management**: Review ProjectContext struct lifecycle for potential memory optimizations

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Visual Indicators**: Enhance sync status indicators with color coding and icons for better visual feedback
- **Configuration Options**: Allow users to customize what context information is displayed
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add hotkeys for quick context refresh and sync status checking

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Error Handling**: Standardize error handling patterns for directory monitoring failures
- **Logging**: Add structured logging for project context changes and sync status updates
- **Documentation**: Create code examples for extending project context functionality

### Integration Opportunities
- **Claude CLI Integration**: Deeper integration with Claude CLI for bidirectional sync status
- **Project Detection**: Automatic project type detection based on directory contents
- **Context Persistence**: Store project context preferences across sessions

## Triage Classification

### High Priority (Immediate Action)
- None identified - story implementation meets all requirements

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)
- Performance optimization considerations for polling frequency
- Enhanced visual indicators for sync status

### Low Priority (Future Consideration)
- User customization options for context display
- Extended project detection capabilities
- Cross-session context persistence

## Story Success Factors
- Clear acceptance criteria enabled focused implementation
- Established project patterns provided solid foundation
- Comprehensive testing approach ensured quality delivery
- BMAD workflow facilitated efficient development process

## Architecture Insights
- Service layer pattern continues to prove effective for feature additions
- Footer component enhancement approach maintains UI consistency
- Type-driven development with structs and enums provides clear contracts
- Integration with existing Claude CLI workflows maintains system coherence

## Recommendations for Future Stories
- Continue using established project patterns and conventions
