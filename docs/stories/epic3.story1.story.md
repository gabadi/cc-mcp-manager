# Story 3.1: NPX Distribution Implementation for mcp-hub-tui

## Status: Done

## Story Approved for Development

**Status:** Approved  
**Approved by:** SM (Scrum Master Agent)  
**Ready for:** Development  
**Created by:** SM (Scrum Master Agent)  
**MVP Focus:** Applied (Core NPX distribution functionality)

## Story

As a developer using Claude Code with MCPs,
I want to install and run mcp-hub using `npx mcp-hub-tui` command,
so that I can easily access the MCP management tool without manual installation or complex setup.

## Business Context

This story implements NPX distribution for mcp-hub, enabling developers to run the tool directly using `npx mcp-hub-tui` without requiring manual binary downloads or installation procedures. This addresses the key user experience gap in MCP tooling distribution and makes mcp-hub easily accessible to the broader Claude Code developer community.

**Epic Context:** Epic 3 - Distribution & Package Management  
**Prerequisites:** Core mcp-hub functionality (Epic 1 & 2) - COMPLETED  
**Timeline:** 8-12 hours (NPX setup, build automation, testing)  
**Strategic Value:** Eliminates installation friction and provides seamless access to mcp-hub across platforms

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: NPX Package Structure & Configuration
- **Given** the mcp-hub project needs NPX distribution
- **When** the npm package is configured
- **Then** a complete npm package structure is established:
  - `package.json` with proper npm configuration for "mcp-hub-tui"
  - `bin` directory with platform-specific executables
  - Platform detection and binary selection logic
  - Proper package metadata and dependencies
- **And** the package supports all 6 target platforms:
  - `@mcp-hub-tui/linux-amd64`, `@mcp-hub-tui/linux-arm64`
  - `@mcp-hub-tui/darwin-amd64`, `@mcp-hub-tui/darwin-arm64`
  - `@mcp-hub-tui/windows-amd64`, `@mcp-hub-tui/windows-arm64`
- **And** package version is synchronized with Go module version

### AC2: NPX Command Execution
- **Given** a developer has Node.js installed
- **When** they run `npx mcp-hub-tui`
- **Then** the command executes successfully:
  - Downloads the package on first run
  - Detects the correct platform automatically
  - Executes the appropriate binary for their system
  - Displays the mcp-hub TUI interface
- **And** subsequent runs use cached package for fast execution
- **And** the command works identically to direct binary execution

### AC3: Cross-Platform Binary Support
- **Given** the npm package contains multiple platform binaries
- **When** `npx mcp-hub-tui` is executed on any supported platform
- **Then** the correct binary is selected and executed:
  - Platform detection works reliably
  - Binary permissions are set correctly (Unix systems)
  - Windows executable runs without additional setup
  - Unsupported platforms show clear error messages
- **And** binary selection is transparent to the user
- **And** no platform-specific configuration is required

### AC4: Automated Build & Release Process
- **Given** the project uses GoReleaser for releases
- **When** a new version is tagged and released
- **Then** the automated process:
  - Builds binaries for all 6 target platforms
  - Creates npm package with all binaries
  - Publishes to npm registry automatically
  - Updates GitHub release with npm package info
- **And** the process is fully automated via GitHub Actions
- **And** manual intervention is only required for version tagging

### AC5: Error Handling & User Experience
- **Given** various error scenarios can occur
- **When** issues are encountered during NPX execution
- **Then** clear error messages are provided:
  - Unsupported platform notifications
  - Binary execution failures
  - Permission errors with resolution guidance
  - Network/download failures with retry suggestions
- **And** error messages include helpful troubleshooting information
- **And** fallback instructions for manual installation are provided

## Technical Debt Considerations

### Potential Technical Debt
- **NPM Package Maintenance:** Ongoing maintenance of NPM package structure
- **Binary Distribution:** Managing multiple platform binaries in single package
- **Version Synchronization:** Keeping Go module and NPM package versions aligned
- **Platform Support:** Adding new platforms requires NPM package updates

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement automated version synchronization
- Create comprehensive testing for new platform additions
- Document NPM package maintenance procedures
- Set up monitoring for package download and usage metrics

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- Selective binary download (download only required platform)
- Binary signature verification for security
- Automatic updates notification system
- Enhanced error reporting and diagnostics

### Considerations for Future Stories
- Package size optimization strategies
- Alternative distribution methods (Homebrew, Chocolatey)
- Enhanced platform detection and fallback mechanisms
- Integration with package managers beyond NPM

## Notes & Considerations

### Design Decisions
- **All-in-one package:** Include all platform binaries in single NPM package (mcp-hub-tui) for simplicity
- **Platform detection:** Use Node.js built-in modules for reliable platform identification
- **Error handling:** Provide clear error messages with actionable resolution steps
- **Automation:** Fully automated release process after initial manual setup
- **Naming Strategy:** NPM package uses "mcp-hub-tui" while internal binary remains "mcp-hub"

### Development Notes
- NPM package approach chosen for broad compatibility and ease of use
- Package name "mcp-hub-tui" chosen to distinguish from potential binary-only "mcp-hub" package
- GoReleaser NPM integration provides seamless automation
- Platform detection logic must be robust and maintainable
- Error scenarios require comprehensive testing and validation

### User Experience Considerations
- First-run experience should be smooth despite package download
- Command name "npx mcp-hub-tui" should be intuitive and memorable
- Cached execution should be nearly instantaneous
- Error messages should guide users to successful resolution
- Documentation should cover common installation and usage scenarios
