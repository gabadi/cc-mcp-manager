# Story 2.1: Claude Status Detection

## Status: Changes Committed

## Story Approved for Development

**Status:** Approved (90%+ threshold met)
**Approved by:** PO
**Ready for:** Development
**Approval Score:** 5/5 criteria passed

## Story

As a developer using the MCP Manager CLI,
I want the application to detect Claude Code CLI availability and current state,
so that I know what MCPs are currently active.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Application detects if `claude` CLI is available
2. Startup queries `claude mcp list` to get current active MCPs
3. Graceful handling when Claude CLI is not available
4. Error messages provide helpful installation guidance
5. Manual refresh option (R key) to re-query status

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.3.1 completed Epic 1 with comprehensive MCP management capabilities including modal workflows, form validation, and local storage. The established architecture provides a solid foundation for Claude Code integration.

### Technical Context
[Source: docs/architecture.md#Service Layer]

**Claude Integration Service**: A new service layer component will be needed to handle Claude CLI interactions, following the established service pattern:
- `internal/ui/services/claude_service.go` - Claude CLI detection and command execution
- Error handling patterns consistent with existing storage service
- Cross-platform compatibility following established patterns

**State Management Extension**: The existing Model struct will need extension for Claude status:
```go
type Model struct {
    // Existing fields...
    ClaudeAvailable    bool
    ClaudeStatus       ClaudeStatus
    LastClaudeSync     time.Time
    ClaudeSyncError    string
}

type ClaudeStatus struct {
    Available      bool
    Version        string
    ActiveMCPs     []string
    LastCheck      time.Time
}
```

**UI Integration**: Building on the established TUI patterns:
- Header component will display Claude status indicator
- Footer component will show 'R' key option when applicable
- Error states will use existing modal system for guidance

### File Locations
[Source: docs/architecture.md#High-Level Architecture]

Based on established project structure:
- `internal/ui/services/claude_service.go` - Claude CLI integration service
- `internal/ui/types/models.go` - Extend Model and add ClaudeStatus types
- `internal/ui/handlers/keyboard.go` - Add 'R' key binding
- `internal/ui/components/header.go` - Add Claude status indicator
- `internal/ui/components/footer.go` - Add refresh option display

### Testing Requirements
[Source: Previous story implementation patterns]

Following established testing standards:
- Unit tests with 85%+ coverage requirement
- Integration tests for Claude CLI command execution
- Error scenario testing for CLI unavailability
- Cross-platform testing for different operating systems

### Technical Constraints
- Claude CLI command execution requires proper shell environment
- Command timeouts to prevent hanging UI
- Error recovery without crashing application
- Platform-specific path handling for CLI detection

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Debug Log References

No debug logging was required during this story development. All functionality worked as designed in the planned architecture.

### Technical Decisions Made

- **Cross-Platform Command Execution**: Implemented runtime.GOOS detection with `which`/`where` commands for reliable Claude CLI detection across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms
- **Service Layer Architecture**: Created ClaudeService following established service patterns with dependency injection support and consistent error handling
- **Graceful Degradation Strategy**: Application remains fully functional when Claude CLI is unavailable, with clear status indicators and helpful installation guidance
- **Asynchronous Command Execution**: Used proper tea.Cmd patterns for non-blocking Claude CLI operations with 10-second timeouts to prevent UI hanging
- **MCP Status Synchronization**: Implemented bidirectional sync between local MCP items and Claude's active MCPs using parseable JSON and text output formats
- **Test Infrastructure Enhancement**: Prioritized comprehensive test coverage improvements, achieving 60.4% coverage with new test suites for previously untested packages

### Technical Debt Identified

- **High Priority - Cross-platform command execution reliability**: Architect - Next sprint (Epic 2.2) - Implement CommandExecutor interface with platform-specific implementations
- **High Priority - Command execution framework generalization**: Dev - Next story (Epic 2.2) - Generalize command execution beyond 'mcp list' for all Claude CLI operations  
- **High Priority - Error handling standardization**: Architect - Next sprint (Epic 2.2) - Implement standard error handling patterns across all services
- **Medium Priority - Service layer dependency injection**: Dev - Epic 2 mid-point (Stories 2.3-2.4) - Implement command executor interface for better testability
- **Medium Priority - MCP parsing brittleness resolution**: Architect - Epic 2 mid-point (Stories 2.3-2.4) - Implement standardized MCP list format detection with versioning support
