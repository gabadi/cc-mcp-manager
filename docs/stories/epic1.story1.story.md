# Epic 1, Story 1: TUI Foundation & Navigation

## Story Overview

**Epic:** Core MCP Inventory Management  
**Story ID:** Epic 1, Story 1  
**Story Title:** TUI Foundation & Navigation  
**Status:** Changes Committed  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 8  

## User Story

As a developer,  
I want a responsive TUI interface with intuitive navigation,  
so that I can efficiently manage my MCP inventory.

## Business Context

This story establishes the foundational TUI interface that will serve as the primary interaction layer for the MCP Manager CLI. It implements the core navigation patterns and responsive layout that all subsequent features will build upon. Success here directly impacts developer productivity and tool adoption.

**Business Value:**
- Provides the essential interface foundation for all MCP management operations
- Establishes familiar terminal navigation patterns for developer efficiency
- Enables responsive design that works across different terminal environments
- Creates the visual framework for status indicators and keyboard shortcuts

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Application Launch with Bubble Tea TUI
- **Given** the MCP Manager CLI is executed
- **When** the application starts
- **Then** it displays a Bubble Tea TUI interface with a 3-column layout
- **And** the interface renders correctly in terminals 80+ columns wide
- **And** the header displays application title and keyboard shortcuts

### AC2: Arrow Key Navigation
- **Given** the TUI is displayed with MCP inventory
- **When** the user presses arrow keys (↑↓←→)
- **Then** the selection cursor moves within and between columns
- **And** the currently selected MCP is visually highlighted
- **And** navigation wraps appropriately at column boundaries

### AC3: Search Field Navigation
- **Given** the TUI is displayed
- **When** the user presses the Tab key
- **Then** focus jumps to the search field
- **And** the search field is visually highlighted
- **And** the user can type search terms

### AC4: Application Exit
- **Given** the TUI is running
- **When** the user presses the ESC key from the main interface
- **Then** the application exits cleanly
- **And** the terminal is restored to its previous state
- **Or** **When** the user presses 'Q' key
- **Then** the application exits with confirmation

### AC5: Responsive Layout Adaptation
- **Given** the application is running in different terminal widths
- **When** the terminal is 80-119 columns wide
- **Then** the interface displays in 3-column layout
- **When** the terminal is 60-79 columns wide  
- **Then** the interface adapts to 2-column layout
- **When** the terminal is less than 60 columns wide
- **Then** the interface displays in single-column layout

### AC6: Keyboard Shortcuts Display
- **Given** the TUI is displayed
- **When** the interface renders
- **Then** the header shows current keyboard shortcuts: [A]dd [E]dit [D]elete [Space]Toggle [R]efresh [Q]uit
- **And** shortcuts are context-appropriate for current mode
- **And** current context is displayed in the status bar

## Technical Requirements

### Framework and Dependencies
- **TUI Framework:** Bubble Tea (github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
- **Styling:** Lipgloss for consistent terminal styling
- **Layout:** Responsive grid system that adapts to terminal width
- **State Management:** Single application state with proper update patterns

### Architecture Patterns
- **MVC Pattern:** Model-View-Controller separation for TUI components
- **Component Structure:** Reusable UI components for lists, modals, and status indicators
- **Event Handling:** Centralized keyboard event processing with command routing
- **State Updates:** Immutable state updates following Bubble Tea patterns

### Performance Requirements
- **Startup Time:** Application must launch and render within 500ms
- **Navigation Responsiveness:** Keyboard navigation must feel instant (<50ms response)
- **Memory Usage:** Minimal memory footprint suitable for resource-constrained environments
- **Terminal Compatibility:** Support for standard ANSI terminal capabilities

  - *Mitigation:* Incremental implementation with thorough testing at each stage
- **Performance on Low-End Systems:** TUI rendering may be slow on older hardware
  - *Mitigation:* Performance testing and optimization from the start

### User Experience Risks
- **Navigation Confusion:** Arrow key behavior may not match user expectations
  - *Mitigation:* Follow established terminal UI patterns and conduct user testing
- **Accessibility:** Limited support for screen readers in terminal environment

## Notes

This story establishes the foundational patterns that all subsequent stories will build upon. Pay special attention to:

1. **State Management Patterns:** The Bubble Tea state update patterns established here will be reused throughout the application
2. **Component Architecture:** Reusable UI components created here should be designed for extension
3. **Navigation Conventions:** Keyboard shortcuts and navigation patterns should be consistent across the entire application
4. **Error Handling:** Terminal compatibility and graceful degradation patterns should be established

The success of this story directly impacts the development velocity of all subsequent features in Epic 1.
