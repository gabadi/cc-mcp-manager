# Story 1.1: TUI Foundation & Navigation

## Status: Changes Committed

## Story Approved for Development

**Status:** Approved (90%+ threshold met)
**Approved by:** PO
**Ready for:** Development
**Approval Score:** 5/5 criteria passed

## Story

- As a developer
- I want a responsive TUI interface with intuitive navigation
- so that I can efficiently manage my MCP inventory

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Application launches with Bubble Tea TUI showing 3-column layout
2. Arrow keys navigate within and between columns
3. Tab key jumps to search field
4. ESC key exits application or clears current mode
5. Responsive layout adapts to terminal width (3/2/1 columns)
6. Header shows keyboard shortcuts and current context

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Initialize Bubble Tea TUI framework (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Set up Go project with Bubble Tea dependency
  - [ ] Create main TUI structure with 3-column layout
  - [ ] Implement application launch and initialization
- [ ] Task 2: Implement keyboard navigation (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Arrow key navigation within columns
  - [ ] Arrow key navigation between columns
  - [ ] Tab key search field focus
  - [ ] ESC key application exit and mode clearing
- [ ] Task 3: Responsive layout system (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement adaptive column layout (3/2/1 columns)
  - [ ] Handle terminal width detection and changes
- [ ] Task 4: Header and context display (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Keyboard shortcuts display in header
  - [ ] Current context indicators
  - [ ] Status area for user feedback

## Dev Notes

This is the foundational story for the MCP Manager CLI TUI. Based on the PRD, this establishes the core interface that users will interact with daily. The TUI should feel responsive and follow standard terminal interface patterns.

Key technical requirements:
- Go language with Bubble Tea framework
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Single binary distribution
- Focus on keyboard-first navigation

Architecture context:
- TUI (Bubble Tea) → Local Storage (JSON) → Claude Code CLI integration
- Local storage in user's home directory or XDG config location

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Go Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Go Integration Test (Test Location): location: `/tests/tui/navigation_test.go`

Manual Test Steps:
- Run the application binary and verify TUI launches with 3-column layout
- Test arrow key navigation works within and between columns
- Verify Tab key focuses search field
- Test ESC key exits application cleanly
- Resize terminal window and verify responsive layout adaptation
- Confirm header displays keyboard shortcuts and current context
