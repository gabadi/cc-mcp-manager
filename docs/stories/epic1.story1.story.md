# Epic 1, Story 1: TUI Foundation & Navigation

**Epic:** Core MCP Inventory Management  
**Story Number:** 1.1  
**Story Status:** Draft  
**Created:** 2025-06-29  
**Scrum Master:** Bob (SM Agent)

## User Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a responsive TUI interface with intuitive navigation,  
**so that** I can efficiently manage my MCP inventory.

## Business Context

This story establishes the foundational TUI interface for the MCP Manager CLI application. It addresses the core developer pain point of MCP management friction by providing an intuitive terminal-based interface using Bubble Tea framework. This is the first story in Epic 1 and is critical for establishing the navigation patterns that all subsequent stories will build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Application Launch & Layout
- **Given** a developer starts the MCP Manager CLI
- **When** the application launches
- **Then** the TUI displays a 3-column layout using Bubble Tea framework
- **And** the interface is responsive and loads within 2 seconds

### AC2: Arrow Key Navigation
- **Given** the TUI is displayed with multiple columns
- **When** the developer uses arrow keys (↑↓←→)
- **Then** navigation works smoothly within the active column
- **And** left/right arrows can switch between columns
- **And** up/down arrows navigate items within the current column

### AC3: Tab Key Functionality
- **Given** the TUI is active with multiple interface elements
- **When** the developer presses the Tab key
- **Then** focus jumps directly to the search field
- **And** the search field is visually highlighted to show focus

### AC4: ESC Key Behavior
- **Given** the TUI is active in any mode or view
- **When** the developer presses the ESC key
- **Then** the application either exits gracefully or clears the current mode
- **And** any modal dialogs or search modes are cancelled
- **And** user returns to the main navigation view

### AC5: Responsive Layout Adaptation
- **Given** the application is running in terminals of different widths
- **When** the terminal width changes or is initially narrow/wide
- **Then** the layout adapts intelligently:
  - Wide terminals (>120 chars): 3 columns displayed
  - Medium terminals (80-120 chars): 2 columns displayed  
  - Narrow terminals (<80 chars): 1 column displayed
- **And** all functionality remains accessible in any layout mode

### AC6: Header Information Display
- **Given** the TUI is active
- **When** the interface is displayed
- **Then** the header shows:
  - Available keyboard shortcuts (A=Add, D=Delete, E=Edit, /=Search, ESC=Exit)
  - Current context information (project directory, active MCPs count)
  - Application title and version
- **And** header information updates based on current mode/context

## Technical Implementation Details

### Framework & Architecture
- **Technology Stack:** Go with Bubble Tea TUI framework
- **State Management:** Centralized application state with Bubble Tea model/update pattern
- **Layout System:** Flexbox-style responsive layout within terminal constraints

### Key Components to Implement
1. **Main Application Model:** Central state container following Bubble Tea patterns
2. **Layout Manager:** Responsive column layout system
3. **Navigation Controller:** Keyboard input handling and focus management  
4. **Header Component:** Dynamic information display
5. **Column Components:** Individual column rendering and interaction

### Navigation State Machine
```
States: [MAIN_NAV, SEARCH_MODE, MODAL_ACTIVE]
Transitions:
- Tab key: MAIN_NAV → SEARCH_MODE
- ESC key: Any state → MAIN_NAV  
- Arrow keys: Navigation within current state
```

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Wide:** >120 characters → 3 columns (40/40/40 split)
- **Medium:** 80-120 characters → 2 columns (50/50 split)
- **Narrow:** <80 characters → 1 column (100% width)

## Definition of Done

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ 3-column responsive layout renders correctly in Bubble Tea
- ✅ Arrow key navigation works smoothly within and between columns
- ✅ Tab key focus management implemented for search field
- ✅ ESC key handling for application exit and mode clearing
- ✅ Responsive layout adaptation based on terminal width
- ✅ Header displays keyboard shortcuts and context information

### Quality Requirements
- ✅ Code follows Go best practices and project conventions
- ✅ Bubble Tea integration follows framework patterns correctly
- ✅ Navigation feels responsive and intuitive for terminal users
- ✅ Layout adaptation is smooth without visual glitches
- ✅ All keyboard shortcuts work as documented

### Testing Requirements
- ✅ Unit tests for navigation logic and state management
- ✅ Manual testing across different terminal sizes
- ✅ Keyboard interaction testing for all supported keys
- ✅ Layout responsiveness validation

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Go development environment configured
- Bubble Tea framework dependency added to project
- Basic project structure established

### External Dependencies
- **Bubble Tea:** Core TUI framework for Go
- **Terminal:** Standard ANSI terminal support required

### Internal Dependencies
- None (this is the foundational story)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Low Risk:** Bubble Tea is well-established and documented
- **Medium Risk:** Terminal size detection across different environments
- **Low Risk:** Keyboard input handling consistency

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use Bubble Tea's built-in terminal size detection
- Test on macOS, Linux, and Windows terminal environments
- Follow Bubble Tea documentation for keyboard handling patterns

## Notes & Considerations

### Design Decisions
- Chose 3-column layout to maximize information density while maintaining readability
- Tab key for search access follows common terminal application patterns
- ESC key behavior provides consistent exit/cancel semantics

### Future Considerations
- Column layout may expand with more advanced features in later stories
- Navigation patterns established here will be reused in all modal dialogs
- Header design should accommodate future status indicators and project context

### Development Notes
- This story focuses purely on navigation foundation - no MCP management logic yet
- Placeholder content can be used for testing layout and navigation
- Emphasis on responsive behavior and smooth user experience
