# Epic 1, Story 4: Edit MCP Capability

**Epic:** Core MCP Inventory Management  
**Story Number:** 1.4  
**Story Status:** Changes Committed  
**Created:** 2025-07-01  
**Scrum Master:** Bob (SM Agent)

## User Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to modify existing MCP details,  
**so that** I can update configurations without re-adding.

## Business Context

Epic 1, Story 4 delivers the essential Edit MCP functionality to complete the core CRUD operations for MCP inventory management. Building on the robust modal system and form validation framework established in Stories 1.3 and 1.3.1, this story implements the ability to modify existing MCP configurations while preserving data integrity and maintaining the consistent user experience patterns.

This capability is critical for daily developer workflow as MCP configurations frequently need updates for different projects, environments, or new requirements. Without edit functionality, users must delete and re-add MCPs, losing historical context and increasing the risk of configuration errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Edit Modal Activation
- **Given** the user is viewing MCPs in the main interface
- **When** the user presses 'E' key on a selected MCP
- **Then** an edit modal opens pre-populated with current MCP details
- **And** the modal displays the appropriate form type (Command/SSE/JSON) based on MCP type
- **And** all existing field values are loaded into the form fields
- **And** the modal title indicates "Edit MCP: [MCP Name]"

### AC2: Form Pre-population and Validation
- **Given** the edit modal is open for an existing MCP
- **When** the form is displayed
- **Then** all current MCP details are pre-populated in appropriate fields
- **And** form validation behaves consistently with add MCP workflow
- **And** required fields are marked and validated in real-time
- **And** environment variables are displayed in proper key=value format
- **And** users can navigate between fields using Tab/Shift+Tab

### AC3: Change Detection and Persistence
- **Given** the user modifies MCP details in the edit form
- **When** the user submits the form (Enter key)
- **Then** the system validates all changes against business rules
- **And** changes are saved to local inventory with atomic operations
- **And** the MCP list refreshes with updated information
- **And** success message confirms the update
- **And** no data is lost if validation fails

### AC4: Edit Workflow Cancellation
- **Given** the user is editing an MCP
- **When** the user presses ESC key
- **Then** the edit modal closes without saving changes
- **And** the interface returns to main navigation
- **And** no changes are persisted to storage
- **And** original MCP data remains unchanged

### AC5: Type-Specific Edit Validation
- **Given** different MCP types (Command/SSE/JSON) in edit mode
- **When** validation occurs during editing
- **Then** type-specific validation rules apply consistently
- **And** Command MCPs validate command path and argument format
- **And** SSE MCPs validate URL format and accessibility
- **And** JSON MCPs validate JSON syntax and structure
- **And** environment variables follow MCP standard format

### Data Models and Storage
MCP data structure for edit operations:
```go
type MCPItem struct {
    Name       string            `json:"name"`
    Type       string            `json:"type"`        // CMD, SSE, JSON
    Active     bool              `json:"active"`
    Command    string            `json:"command,omitempty"`
    Args       []string          `json:"args,omitempty"`
    URL        string            `json:"url,omitempty"`
    JSONConfig string            `json:"json_config,omitempty"`
    EnvVars    map[string]string `json:"env_vars,omitempty"`
}
```

Storage service provides:
- Atomic file operations with temporary file safety
- JSON serialization with metadata and versioning
- Error handling and recovery with backup support
- Cross-platform compatibility
