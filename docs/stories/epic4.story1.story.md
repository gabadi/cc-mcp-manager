# Epic 4, Story 1: Platform Abstraction Architecture & Legacy Code Elimination

**Epic:** Platform Abstraction and System Modernization  
**Story Number:** 4.1  
**Story Status:** Not Started  
**Created:** 2025-07-06  
**Scrum Master:** Technical Lead

## User Story

**As a** developer working on the mcp-hub project,  
**I want** a centralized platform abstraction layer that eliminates all legacy code references and provides consistent cross-platform behavior,  
**so that** the application runs reliably across all supported platforms without hardcoded platform-specific implementations scattered throughout the codebase.

## Business Context

This story addresses critical technical debt and architectural inconsistencies that have accumulated throughout the system's evolution. The current codebase contains scattered platform-specific code, legacy references to the old "cc-mcp-manager" naming, and hardcoded paths that create maintenance overhead and limit platform compatibility.

By implementing a comprehensive platform abstraction layer, we eliminate technical debt while establishing a foundation for reliable cross-platform operation. This story directly supports the system's architectural goals of maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## Technical Problem Analysis

### Current Issues Identified

1. **Legacy Code Contamination:**
   - References to "cc-mcp-manager" in storage service
   - Migration logic for old application names
   - Hardcoded legacy directory paths

2. **Platform-Specific Code Scatter:**
   - Runtime.GOOS checks spread across multiple files
   - Inconsistent platform detection patterns
   - Duplicate platform logic in different services

3. **Hardcoded System Paths:**
   - "/tmp/mcp-hub.log" hardcoded in main.go
   - Fixed path assumptions that break on different platforms
   - No dynamic path resolution based on platform conventions

4. **Service Dependencies:**
   - Clipboard service has platform-specific implementations
   - Claude service uses platform-specific command detection
   - No unified platform capability detection

### Architecture Impact

The current scattered approach creates:
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Platform logic duplicated across services
- **Testing Complexity:** Multiple platform-specific code paths to test
- **Scalability Issues:** Adding new platforms requires changes in multiple files
- **Technical Debt:** Legacy code mixed with current implementations

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Platform Abstraction Service Implementation
- **Given** the need for consistent cross-platform behavior
- **When** the platform abstraction service is implemented
- **Then** it provides a unified interface for all platform-specific operations
- **And** all platform detection logic is centralized in one location
- **And** the service implements the Platform interface with methods for:
  - GetPlatform() PlatformType
  - GetLogPath() string
  - GetConfigPath() string
  - GetTempPath() string
  - GetCommandDetectionMethod() string
  - SupportsClipboard() bool
  - GetClipboardMethod() ClipboardMethod

### AC2: Platform-Specific Service Implementations
- **Given** the platform abstraction interface
- **When** platform-specific services are implemented
- **Then** each supported platform (darwin, windows, linux) has its own service implementation
- **And** darwin service implements macOS-specific behaviors:
  - Uses ~/Library/Application Support for config if appropriate
  - Implements pbcopy/pbpaste clipboard operations
  - Uses "which" command for binary detection
  - Follows macOS path conventions
- **And** windows service implements Windows-specific behaviors:
  - Uses appropriate Windows directories (AppData)
  - Implements Windows clipboard operations
  - Uses "where" command for binary detection
  - Follows Windows path conventions
- **And** linux service implements Linux-specific behaviors:
  - Uses XDG directory specifications
  - Implements appropriate clipboard operations
  - Uses "which" command for binary detection
  - Follows Linux path conventions

### AC3: Legacy Code Complete Elimination
- **Given** the current codebase with legacy references
- **When** legacy code elimination is complete
- **Then** all references to "cc-mcp-manager" are removed
- **And** all references to "oldAppName" are removed
- **And** all migration logic for old application names is removed
- **And** no hardcoded legacy paths remain in the codebase
- **And** the application starts with a clean slate on first run

### AC4: Dynamic Path Resolution
- **Given** the platform abstraction service
- **When** the application needs system paths
- **Then** all paths are resolved dynamically based on platform conventions
- **And** log files are placed in appropriate platform-specific locations:
  - macOS: ~/Library/Logs/mcp-hub/
  - Windows: %APPDATA%/mcp-hub/logs/
  - Linux: ~/.local/share/mcp-hub/logs/
- **And** no hardcoded paths like "/tmp/mcp-hub.log" exist
- **And** all path resolution goes through the platform service

### AC5: Service Refactoring for Platform Abstraction
- **Given** existing services with platform-specific code
- **When** services are refactored to use platform abstraction
- **Then** clipboard service uses platform abstraction for all operations
- **And** claude service uses platform abstraction for command detection
- **And** storage service uses platform abstraction for path resolution
- **And** main.go uses platform abstraction for log file paths
- **And** no service contains direct runtime.GOOS checks
- **And** all platform-specific logic is delegated to the platform service

### AC6: Comprehensive Testing Coverage
- **Given** the platform abstraction implementation
- **When** tests are executed
- **Then** each platform service implementation has >90% test coverage
- **And** platform abstraction interface has comprehensive test coverage
- **And** refactored services maintain their existing test coverage
- **And** integration tests verify platform-specific behaviors work correctly
- **And** mock platform services are available for testing other components

## Technical Implementation Details

### Platform Abstraction Interface Design

```go
// PlatformType represents the supported operating system platforms
type PlatformType int

const (
    PlatformUnknown PlatformType = iota
    PlatformDarwin

)

// ClipboardMethod represents the clipboard access method for the platform
type ClipboardMethod int

const (
    ClipboardUnsupported ClipboardMethod = iota
    ClipboardNative
    ClipboardPbcopy
    ClipboardXclip
    ClipboardPowershell
)

// PlatformService defines the interface for platform-specific operations
type PlatformService interface {
    // Platform identification
    GetPlatform() PlatformType
    GetPlatformName() string
    
    // Path resolution
    GetLogPath() string
    GetConfigPath() string
    GetTempPath() string
    GetCachePath() string
    
    // Command utilities
    GetCommandDetectionMethod() string
    GetCommandDetectionCommand() string
    
    // Clipboard operations
    SupportsClipboard() bool
    GetClipboardMethod() ClipboardMethod
    
    // File operations
    GetDefaultFilePermissions() os.FileMode
    GetDefaultDirectoryPermissions() os.FileMode
    
    // Environment utilities
    GetEnvironmentVariable(key string) string
    GetHomeDirectory() string
    GetCurrentUser() string
}
```

    }
}
```

### Service Integration Pattern

```go
// Service integration example - ClipboardService refactored
type ClipboardService struct {
    platformService PlatformService
    // ... other fields
}

func NewClipboardService(platformService PlatformService) *ClipboardService {
    return &ClipboardService{
        platformService: platformService,
        // ... other initialization
    }
}

func (cs *ClipboardService) Copy(text string) error {
    if !cs.platformService.SupportsClipboard() {
        return fmt.Errorf("clipboard operations not supported on this platform")
    }
    
    method := cs.platformService.GetClipboardMethod()
    switch method {
    case ClipboardPbcopy:
        return cs.copyWithPbcopy(text)
    case ClipboardXclip:
        return cs.copyWithXclip(text)
    case ClipboardPowershell:
        return cs.copyWithPowershell(text)
    default:
        return cs.copyWithGeneric(text)
    }
}
```
