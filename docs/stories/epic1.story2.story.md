## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the second story in Epic 1. No previous story exists yet, so this establishes the foundation for persistent storage that will be used by all subsequent MCP management operations.

### Data Models
Based on the PRD requirements, the JSON storage must support multiple MCP types:
- **Command/Binary MCPs**: Name and command path
- **SSE Server MCPs**: Name and server URL
- **JSON Configuration MCPs**: Name and configuration details
- **HTTP MCPs**: Name and endpoint details

### Technical Context
- **Language**: Go with standard library JSON package
- **Storage Location**: Use XDG Base Directory specification or OS-appropriate config directory
- **File Format**: JSON for transparency and debuggability (NFR2 from PRD)
- **Error Handling**: Must gracefully recover from Claude Code CLI failures (NFR3 from PRD)

### File Locations
Based on standard Go project structure:
- Create `pkg/storage/` for storage interfaces and implementations
- Create `pkg/models/` for MCP data structures
- Create `pkg/config/` for configuration management
- Update `main.go` to initialize storage on startup

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for JSON marshaling/unmarshaling
- Unit tests for file I/O operations with temporary files
- Integration tests for config directory creation
- Error handling tests for corrupted files

### Technical Constraints
- JSON format required for transparency (NFR2)
- Graceful error handling for CLI failures (NFR3)
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Single binary distribution requirement

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Go Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Go Integration Test (Test Location): location: `/pkg/storage/storage_test.go`
- [ ] Manual Test Steps included below

Manual Test Steps:
- Create application instance and verify config file creation in appropriate directory
- Test application restart to confirm inventory persistence
- Manually corrupt JSON file to verify graceful recovery
- Add various MCP types to verify schema support
- Check logs for config file location reporting

## Implementation Completed

**Status:** Complete
**Quality Gates:** PASS

### Technical Decisions Made

- **XDG Config Directory Compliance**: Chose XDG Base Directory specification for Linux systems while maintaining OS-appropriate locations for macOS/Windows to ensure cross-platform compatibility and user expectation compliance
- **Multi-Level Error Recovery Strategy**: Implemented comprehensive backup/restore mechanism with atomic writes and graceful degradation to handle corrupted files, missing configurations, and I/O failures
- **Interface-Based Storage Abstraction**: Designed `InventoryStorage` interface to enable future storage backends while maintaining clean separation of concerns and testability
- **JSON Format Selection**: Selected JSON over binary formats for transparency, debuggability, and human readability as specified in NFR2 requirements
- **Cross-Platform File Locking**: Implemented channel-based locking mechanism using Go concurrency patterns instead of OS-specific file locks for consistent behavior across platforms

### Technical Debt Identified

- **Development Environment Standardization**: architect - Before Epic 1 starts
- **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement**: architect - Before Epic 1 starts  
- **File Locking Architecture Consistency**: dev team - Next sprint
- **CLI/TUI Design Patterns Framework**: dev team - Next sprint
- **Performance Monitoring Integration**: architect + dev - Next epic
