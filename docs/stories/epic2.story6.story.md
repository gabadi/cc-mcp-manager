## Status: Done - Delivered

## Story Approved for Development

**Status:** Approved (100% threshold met)
**Approved by:** PO
**Ready for:** Development
**Approval Score:** 5/5 criteria passed
**Approval Date:** 2025-07-03
**Created by:** SM (Scrum Master Agent)
**MVP Focus:** Applied (80/20 principle)

## Story

As a developer using the MCP Manager CLI,
I want clear feedback during app startup and refresh ('R') operations,
so that I know the app is working and not frozen during these critical loading moments.

## Business Context

This story addresses the specific user pain points identified in Epic 2 user testing: confusion during app startup and refresh operations. Users report uncertainty about whether the app is working or frozen during these 3-10+ second operations. This focused loading system will provide clear feedback for these two critical scenarios only.

**Epic Context:** Epic 2 - Enhanced MCP Management & Claude Integration  
**Prerequisites:** Stories 2.1 (Claude Detection) & 2.2 (MCP Toggle) - COMPLETED  
**Timeline:** 6-7 hours (Focused scope - startup and refresh only)  
**Strategic Value:** Eliminates user confusion during app startup and refresh operations while preserving the well-functioning individual toggle UX from Story 2.2

## Acceptance Criteria (Focused Scope)

### AC1: Application Startup Loading Overlay
- **Given** the application is launched
- **When** startup operations are performed (typically 3-6 seconds)
- **Then** a loading overlay appears with simple progress messages:
  - "Initializing MCP Manager..."
  - "Loading MCP inventory..."
  - "Detecting Claude CLI..."
  - "Ready!"
- **And** messages progress automatically without specific timing
- **And** overlay disappears when startup completes
- **And** if startup fails, clear error message is shown

### AC2: Refresh ('R') Operation Loading Overlay
- **Given** user presses 'R' to refresh
- **When** refresh operation is in progress (typically 5-15 seconds)
- **Then** a loading overlay appears with progress messages:
  - "Refreshing MCP status..."
  - "Syncing with Claude CLI..."
  - "Updating display..."
  - "Complete!"
- **And** messages show the refresh is working, not frozen
- **And** overlay disappears when refresh completes
- **And** if refresh fails, clear error message with retry option is shown

### AC3: ESC Cancellation Support
- **Given** startup or refresh loading overlay is active
- **When** user presses ESC key
- **Then** cancellation prompt appears: "Cancel operation? [Y/N]"
- **And** confirming cancellation (Y) stops operation and returns to previous state
- **And** declining cancellation (N) continues the loading operation
- **And** startup cancellation exits the application safely
- **And** refresh cancellation returns to the current MCP state

### AC4: Smooth Visual Integration
- **Given** loading overlays are displayed
- **When** user sees the interface
- **Then** overlays integrate cleanly with existing UI:
  - Semi-transparent background dims main content
  - Loading dialog is centered and clearly visible
  - Messages use consistent app typography and colors
  - Smooth transitions when appearing/disappearing
- **And** overlay never interferes with existing toggle UX from Story 2.2
- **And** individual MCP loading states (⏳ → ✅/◦ → ●/○) remain unchanged

```

**Visual Specifications:**
- **Background**: Semi-transparent dark overlay (80% opacity) over main interface
- **Dialog Box**: Centered modal with clean, simple design
- **Messages**: Single line showing current operation with animated spinner
- **Typography**: Consistent with existing app theme
- **Colors**: Simple blue spinner, standard text colors
- **NO CHANGES**: Individual toggle UX (⏳ → ✅/◦ → ●/○) remains exactly as implemented in Story 2.2

### Simple Loading Messages

#### Startup Messages (3-6 seconds total)
1. "Initializing MCP Manager..."
2. "Loading MCP inventory..."
3. "Detecting Claude CLI..."
4. "Ready!"

#### Refresh Messages (5-15 seconds total)
1. "Refreshing MCP status..."
2. "Syncing with Claude CLI..."
3. "Updating display..."
4. "Complete!"

**Implementation Notes:**
- Messages progress automatically based on actual operations
- No complex timing or percentage calculations
- Simple animated spinner (◐◓◑◒) beside current message
- Clear error messages if operations fail

### Visual Indicators

#### Spinner Animation
- **Loading Spinner**: ◐◓◑◒ (4-frame rotation, 200ms intervals)
- **Used only for**: Current operation in loading overlay

#### Typography
- **Title**: "MCP Manager" (consistent with app)
- **Messages**: Regular text, same as existing UI
- **Errors**: Clear, actionable error messages

### Simple Cancellation UX

#### ESC Key Interaction
1. **User presses ESC** during startup or refresh loading
2. **Simple prompt**: "Cancel operation? [Y/N]"
3. **User confirms (Y)** → Stop operation, exit app (startup) or return to current state (refresh)
4. **User declines (N)** → Continue loading operation
5. **No complex warnings** → These are safe operations to cancel

### Simplified User Flows

#### Startup Flow
1. App launches → Show loading overlay
2. Progress through startup messages
3. Complete → Hide overlay, show main UI
4. Error → Show error message with retry option
5. ESC pressed → Cancel startup, exit app

#### Refresh Flow
1. User presses 'R' → Show loading overlay
2. Progress through refresh messages
3. Complete → Hide overlay, show updated UI
4. Error → Show error message with retry option
5. ESC pressed → Cancel refresh, return to current state

## Simplified Technical Implementation

### Loading Overlay Component
```go
type LoadingOverlay struct {
    Active      bool
    Message     string
    Spinner     SpinnerState
    Cancellable bool
    Type        LoadingType // STARTUP or REFRESH
}

type LoadingType int
const (
    LOADING_STARTUP LoadingType = iota
    LOADING_REFRESH
)
```

### Model Integration
```go
type Model struct {
    // Existing fields from Stories 2.1 and 2.2...
    
    // Simple loading overlay state
    LoadingOverlay *LoadingOverlay
}
```

### Implementation Scope
- **ONLY**: Startup and refresh loading overlays
- **NO CHANGES**: Individual MCP toggle loading (Story 2.2 implementation remains unchanged)

- **Medium Priority:** Component architecture standardization

### New Technical Debt Prevention
- Implement loading system with reusable service patterns
- Create standardized loading state management interfaces
- Use dependency injection for loading service integration
- Establish performance monitoring patterns for loading operations

## Notes & Considerations

### Design Decisions
- Focus on the two operations where users experience confusion: startup and refresh
- Simple message progression provides clarity without complexity
- ESC cancellation offers basic user control for long operations
- Preserve the well-functioning individual toggle UX from Story 2.2
- Avoid over-engineering with complex progress systems

### Future Considerations
- This scope addresses the immediate user pain points
- Additional loading scenarios can be evaluated in future epics if needed
- Current individual toggle UX (Story 2.2) works well and should remain unchanged

### Development Notes
- Story addresses specific user feedback about startup and refresh confusion
- Implementation should be simple and focused on two scenarios only
- Reduced scope from 8-12 hours to 6-7 hours of implementation time
- Emphasis on solving actual user problems rather than comprehensive loading system
