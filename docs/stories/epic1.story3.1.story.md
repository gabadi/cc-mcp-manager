# Epic 1, Story 3.1: MCP Workflow Critical Issues Resolution

**Epic:** Core MCP Inventory Management  
**Story Number:** 1.3.1  
**Story Status:** Ready for Development  
**Created:** 2025-07-01  
**Scrum Master:** Bob (SM Agent)

## User Story

**As a** developer using the MCP Manager CLI,  
**I want** all critical issues with the Add MCP workflow to be resolved,  
**so that** I can efficiently add MCPs without encountering broken functionality or usability issues.

## Business Context

Epic 1, Story 3 successfully delivered the core Add MCP workflow foundation, but user feedback and architect analysis have identified 6 critical issues that significantly impact user experience and MCP standard compliance. This story addresses these issues to ensure the MCP Manager CLI meets production quality standards and follows MCP configuration standards properly.

Building on the established modal architecture from Story 3, this story focuses on fixing broken functionality (delete operations), adding missing standard compliance features (environment variables support), and improving user experience (clipboard integration, simplified command line interface).

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Delete Functionality Implementation (Critical - Priority 1)
- **Given** the user is viewing MCPs in the main interface
- **When** the user presses 'D' key on a selected MCP
- **Then** a delete confirmation modal appears showing MCP details
- **And** when user presses 'Enter' in the confirmation modal
- **Then** the MCP is permanently removed from inventory and storage
- **And** the interface returns to main navigation with success confirmation
- **And** the MCP list refreshes without the deleted item

### AC2: Environment Variables Support (MCP Standard Compliance - Priority 1)
- **Given** any MCP form (Command/Binary, SSE Server, JSON Configuration)
- **When** the form is displayed
- **Then** an "Environment Variables" field is available
- **And** users can input key=value pairs (one per line or comma-separated)
- **And** environment variables are validated for proper format
- **And** environment variables are stored and loaded with MCP configuration
- **And** environment variables follow MCP standard specification

### AC3: Clipboard Integration for TUI (UX Enhancement - Priority 2)
- **Given** any text input field in MCP forms
- **When** user presses 'Ctrl+V' 
- **Then** clipboard content is pasted into the active field
- **And** when user presses 'Ctrl+C' on selected text or field content
- **Then** content is copied to system clipboard
- **And** clipboard operations work across all supported operating systems
- **And** long clipboard content is handled gracefully without breaking layout

### AC4: Command Line Arguments Simplification (User Feedback - Priority 2)
- **Given** the Command/Binary MCP form
- **When** users input command line arguments in the Args field
- **Then** both string format ("arg1 arg2 arg3") and array format (["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"]) are supported
- **And** automatic conversion between formats is provided
- **And** validation shows clear feedback about accepted formats
- **And** help text explains both input methods
- **And** saved configuration uses the correct array format for MCP standard compliance

### AC5: Enhanced JSON Validation Feedback (User Confidence - Priority 2)
- **Given** the JSON Configuration MCP form
- **When** user enters JSON content
- **Then** real-time syntax validation shows specific error location (line:column)
- **And** valid JSON shows clear visual confirmation with checkmark
- **And** JSON formatting suggestions are provided for common errors
- **And** schema validation hints are provided for MCP-specific JSON structure
- **And** large JSON content is handled with proper scrolling

### AC6: Improved Modal Navigation and Error Recovery (UX Polish - Priority 3)
- **Given** any modal is active with form errors
- **When** user attempts to navigate or submit
- **Then** focus automatically moves to the first field with an error
- **And** error messages include actionable guidance for resolution  
- **And** ESC key provides consistent cancellation from any modal state
- **And** modal state is preserved during validation errors
- **And** keyboard shortcuts remain responsive throughout modal operations
