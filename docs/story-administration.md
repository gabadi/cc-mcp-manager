# Story Administration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the administrative processes, procedures, and governance for story management within the MCP Manager project, ensuring consistent story lifecycle management and Epic progression.

## Story Lifecycle Management

### Story States

1. **Draft** - Initial story creation and requirements gathering
2. **Approved** - Business validation completed, ready for development
3. **In Development** - Active implementation phase
4. **Under Review** - Multi-agent review process (Architecture, QA, UX, Business, Process)
5. **Fixes Applied** - Post-review fixes implemented
6. **Completed** - All acceptance criteria met, ready for Epic integration

### State Transitions

```
Draft → Approved → In Development → Under Review → Fixes Applied → Completed
   ↑                                      ↓
   └──────────── Rejected ←──────────────┘
```

### Story Administration Responsibilities

#### Product Owner (PO)
- **Story Approval**: Validate business requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Priority Management**: Ensure story aligns with Epic objectives
- **Business Review**: Conduct business validation during review process
- **Quality Gates**: Approve story completion against business criteria

#### Scrum Master (SM)
- **Process Compliance**: Ensure adherence to story administration procedures
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Manage story lifecycle transitions
- **Review Coordination**: Orchestrate multi-agent review processes
- **Documentation Standards**: Ensure proper story documentation

#### Development Team (Dev)
- **Implementation Execution**: Deliver story functionality per acceptance criteria
- **Technical Documentation**: Maintain dev notes and technical context
- **Code Quality**: Ensure implementation meets technical standards
- **Test Coverage**: Achieve minimum 80% test coverage requirement

### Administrative Procedures

#### Story Creation Process

1. **Epic Context Review**: Ensure story fits within Epic scope and objectives
2. **Requirements Definition**: Define clear acceptance criteria and tasks
3. **Technical Assessment**: Review technical constraints and dependencies
4. **Approval Workflow**: Submit for PO approval with business justification
5. **Development Setup**: Initialize story implementation environment

#### Story Review Process

The multi-agent review system ensures comprehensive quality validation:

**Round 1: Comprehensive Review**
- **Architecture Review**: Technical design and implementation quality (Target: 9.0+/10)
- **Business Review**: Requirements fulfillment and business value (Target: 100% approval)
- **Process Review**: Compliance with development and documentation standards (Target: FULL COMPLIANCE)
- **QA Review**: Code quality, testing, and production readiness (Target: 9.0+/10)
- **UX Review**: User experience and interface quality (Target: 8.5+/10)

**Review Consolidation**: Issues and decisions are consolidated with priority classification:
- **BLOCKER**: Issues preventing story completion
- **QUALITY-STANDARD**: Issues affecting code quality standards
- **IMPROVEMENT**: Enhancement opportunities

**Round 2+: Efficient Validation**: Post-fix validation focusing on addressed issues

#### Story Completion Criteria

**Mandatory Requirements:**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- [ ] Minimum 80% test coverage achieved
- [ ] All review issues resolved (BLOCKER items must be addressed)
- [ ] Documentation updated (including dev notes and change log)
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified
- [ ] Production readiness assessment completed

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] Build: PASS
- [ ] Tests: PASS
- [ ] Linting: PASS
- [ ] Security: PASS
- [ ] Performance: Within acceptable parameters

### Documentation Requirements

#### Story Documentation Standards

**Required Sections:**
- Story statement with clear user value proposition
- Comprehensive acceptance criteria with validation criteria
- Task breakdown with AC traceability
- Dev notes including technical context and constraints
- Testing requirements (unit, integration, manual)
- File list and change log

**Development Documentation:**
- Agent model used for implementation
- Debug log references (if applicable)
- Completion notes for Epic progression
- File modifications list
- Change tracking with version history

#### Administrative Records

**Story Administration File**: `.story-implementation/`
- `issues-found.md` - Consolidated review issues
- `decisions-needed.md` - Technical decisions and rationale
- `fixes-summary.md` - Implementation fixes documentation

### Epic Integration

#### Epic Progress Tracking

- **Story Completion Percentage**: Automatic calculation based on completed stories
- **Learning Integration**: Consolidate story learnings into Epic knowledge base
- **Dependency Management**: Track inter-story dependencies within Epic scope
- **Quality Metrics**: Aggregate quality scores across Epic stories

#### Epic Completion Triggers

When Epic reaches 100% story completion:
- **Automatic Retrospective**: Multi-agent collaborative analysis
- **Learning Consolidation**: Extract strategic insights and action items
- **Knowledge Base Update**: Document Epic outcomes and lessons learned
- **Next Epic Preparation**: Transition planning for subsequent Epics

### Governance and Compliance

#### Process Compliance Validation

**Administrative Checklist:**
- [ ] Story follows standard template structure
- [ ] All required documentation sections completed
- [ ] Agent assignments appropriate for story complexity
- [ ] Review process completed with all agents
- [ ] Issues properly tracked and resolved
- [ ] Quality gates validated and passing

#### Quality Assurance

**Review Quality Standards:**
- Architecture Review: 9.0+/10 target score
- QA Review: 9.0+/10 target score  
- UX Review: 8.5+/10 target score
- Business Review: 100% approval rate
- Process Review: FULL COMPLIANCE required

#### Risk Management

**Common Risk Mitigation:**
- **Scope Creep**: Regular AC validation against original requirements
- **Technical Debt**: Architecture review validation before story completion
- **Quality Degradation**: Mandatory quality gate validation
- **Documentation Gaps**: Process review compliance verification

### Tools and Integration

#### Required Tools
- Git repository with proper branch management
- Build system integration (automatically detected)
- Testing framework appropriate to project type
- GitHub CLI for PR creation (recommended)

#### Workflow Integration
- **Simple Workflow**: 9 steps for straightforward changes
- **Implementation Workflow**: 15 comprehensive steps for complex features
- **Multi-Agent Review**: Coordinated review process with consolidation
- **Learning System**: Six-category learning extraction and triage
