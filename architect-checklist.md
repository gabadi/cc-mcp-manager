# Architecture Review Checklist

## Round 1: TUI Foundation Architecture Review

### Architecture Quality Assessment

#### 1. Design Patterns & Architecture
- [ ] MVC/MVP pattern implementation
- [ ] Component separation and boundaries
- [ ] State management approach
- [ ] Event handling architecture
- [ ] Interface design and abstractions

#### 2. Scalability & Extensibility
- [ ] Code structure supports future features
- [ ] Modular design enables component reuse
- [ ] Configuration and customization points
- [ ] Plugin/extension architecture readiness
- [ ] Performance under load considerations

#### 3. Maintainability & Code Quality
- [ ] Code organization and structure
- [ ] Naming conventions and consistency
- [ ] Documentation and inline comments
- [ ] Error handling patterns
- [ ] Logging and debugging support

#### 4. Technical Implementation
- [ ] Framework usage best practices
- [ ] Dependency management
- [ ] Build and deployment pipeline
- [ ] Testing strategy and coverage
- [ ] Performance optimization

#### 5. Standards & Conventions
- [ ] Coding standards adherence
- [ ] Go best practices implementation
- [ ] Terminal/TUI conventions
- [ ] Accessibility considerations
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility

#### 6. Security & Robustness
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Error boundary implementation
- [ ] Resource management
- [ ] Memory leak prevention
- [ ] Terminal state cleanup

### Review Process
1. Analyze implementation against story requirements
2. Evaluate architectural decisions and trade-offs
3. Identify potential issues and improvements
4. Assess foundation quality for future development
5. Document findings and recommendations

### Output Requirements
- Technical architecture assessment
- Code quality evaluation
- Scalability and maintainability review
- Risk identification and mitigation
- Recommendations for improvements
