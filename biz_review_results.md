| Acceptance criteria are measurable | ✅ PASS | **Measurable ACs:** All 6 acceptance criteria include specific, testable conditions with clear given-when-then format. |
| Edge cases and error scenarios considered | ✅ PASS | **Edge Cases Covered:** Terminal compatibility issues, responsive behavior across different widths, performance on low-end systems, accessibility considerations. |

### ✅ User Experience - PASSED

| Criteria | Status | Assessment |
|----------|--------|------------|
| User journeys are mapped | ✅ PASS | **Journey Mapping:** Clear navigation flows documented - arrow key movement, tab to search, ESC to exit, keyboard shortcuts for all operations. |
| Interface design patterns established | ✅ PASS | **Design Patterns:** 3-column responsive layout, header with shortcuts, status indicators, consistent navigation patterns following terminal conventions. |
| Accessibility requirements considered | ✅ PASS | **Accessibility Planning:** Comprehensive keyboard navigation, screen reader considerations noted, visual feedback patterns established. |

### ✅ Definition of Done - PASSED

| Criteria | Status | Assessment |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Story breakdown is complete | ✅ PASS | **Complete Breakdown:** Story includes functional completeness, technical quality, user experience, and documentation requirements. |
| Acceptance criteria are testable | ✅ PASS | **Testable Criteria:** All ACs include specific test conditions, unit testing approach defined, integration testing scope documented. |

### ✅ Epic-Specific Validation - PASSED

| Criteria | Status | Assessment |
|----------|--------|------------|
| TUI framework choice validated | ✅ PASS | **Framework Validation:** Bubble Tea confirmed for rich terminal interface, Lipgloss for styling, Go for cross-platform compatibility. |
| Navigation patterns established | ✅ PASS | **Navigation Patterns:** Arrow keys for movement, Tab for search focus, ESC for exit/cancel, keyboard shortcuts for operations. |
