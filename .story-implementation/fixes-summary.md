2. **Next Sprint:** Refine integration tests to match actual behavior or fix behavior to match expectations
3. **Future:** Use integration tests as regression prevention for Story 1.3 implementation

### Continuous Improvement
1. **Regular Review Cycles:** Monthly testing and architecture documentation reviews
2. **Metrics Tracking:** Establish trending for coverage, performance, and quality metrics
3. **Team Training:** Ensure all team members understand new testing standards
