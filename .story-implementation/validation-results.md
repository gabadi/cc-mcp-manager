## Validation Results

### Remaining Issues

- **Test Failure in Model Integration** - TestModel_Integration/Model_with_realistic_MCP_data expects >=10 MCP items but loaded inventory only has 5 items
- **Quality Gate Failure** - Tests failing due to expectation mismatch between test data requirements and production data

### Additional Fixes Needed

- **Fix Test Data Expectations** - Either update test to work with realistic inventory sizes or ensure default data is used in test environment
- **Clarify Data Loading Strategy** - Determine if tests should use default substantial data or real production data for validation
