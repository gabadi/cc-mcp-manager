    epic_1_impact: "High - Epic 1 features heavily depend on CLI interface quality"

  - item: "Performance Monitoring Integration"
    priority: "MEDIUM"
    owner: "architect + dev"
    timeline: "Next epic"
    action: "Expose metrics via HTTP endpoint, add performance baselines"
    impact: "Production readiness and operational insights for MCP operations"
    consensus: "Product + Development team - essential for production deployment"
    epic_1_impact: "Medium - Epic 1 needs monitoring for production use"
```

## Team Consensus Decisions

### High Priority Consensus
- **Infrastructure First**: Team unanimously agreed development environment and CI/CD must be completed before Epic 1 development begins
- **User Experience Focus**: CLI/TUI patterns are critical given Epic 1's interface-heavy features
- **Concurrent Safety**: File locking standardization needed for production reliability

### Removed Items by Consensus
- **Validation Framework Consolidation**: Current implementation functional, not Epic 1 blocking
- **MCP Discovery Features**: Future epic opportunity, deferred for post-Epic 1
- **Error Context Enhancement**: Low impact on Epic 1 development velocity
- **Test Data Management**: Process improvement, not critical path
- **Documentation Automation**: Nice-to-have, not Epic 1 dependency

### Ownership Assignments
- **Architect**: Infrastructure, tooling, and architectural consistency items
- **Development Team**: Implementation-focused items requiring code changes
- **Shared (Architect + Dev)**: Items requiring both architectural planning and implementation

## Epic 1 Preparation Checklist

### Before Epic 1 Development Starts
- [ ] Complete development environment standardization
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline with cross-platform builds
- [ ] Document CLI design patterns and guidelines

### During Epic 1 Development
- [ ] Apply consistent file locking across new features
- [ ] Follow established CLI/TUI patterns for user interfaces
- [ ] Integrate performance monitoring as features are developed

## Success Criteria Validation

- [x] All learning items validated for actionability
- [x] Priority assigned based on development impact and team consensus
- [x] Clear ownership for each item with timeline commitments
- [x] Specific timelines aligned with Epic 1 preparation needs
- [x] Ready for technical planning integration and PR inclusion

## Integration with Epic 1 Planning

These final learning items will be:
1. **Integrated into Epic 1 technical planning** as prerequisites and parallel work streams
2. **Tracked in technical debt register** with clear ownership and timelines  
3. **Included in PR documentation** for Epic 1 preparation visibility
4. **Referenced in team retrospectives** to measure completion and impact

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Sprint)**: Begin development environment standardization and CI/CD setup
2. **Short-term (Next Sprint)**: Complete file locking consistency and CLI pattern documentation
3. **Epic 1 Integration**: Validate all items are complete or in progress before Epic 1 development begins
4. **Tracking**: Add items to team backlog with assigned owners and timelines
