## Party Mode Consensus Decisions

### Critical Epic 2.2 Blockers (HIGH Priority)

**Consensus**: These items MUST be addressed before Epic 2.2 development begins.

1. **Cross-platform reliability** - Windows `where` vs Unix `which` command issues will block Epic 2.2 MCP activation functionality
2. **Command execution framework** - Current limitation to `mcp list` only prevents MCP activation toggle implementation
3. **Error handling standardization** - Inconsistent error patterns will create poor user experience as Epic 2 functionality expands

### Supporting Epic 2 Development (MEDIUM Priority)

**Consensus**: These items improve Epic 2 development quality but don't block progress.

1. **Dependency injection** - Improves testability but current 60.4% coverage is acceptable for Epic 2.2
2. **MCP parsing improvements** - Current implementation works but needs hardening for production

### Items Removed from Final List

**Collaborative Decision**: The following items were validated but removed as they don't meet immediate Epic 2 impact criteria:

- Performance regression testing → Backlog (no performance issues identified)
- Behavior-driven testing framework → Nice-to-have (current testing adequate)
- Configuration management → Future work (hard-coded values work for Epic 2)
- Real-time status monitoring → Epic 2.3+ feature (not needed for 2.2)
- Service composition framework → Over-engineering for current Epic 2 scope

## Epic 2 Continuation Strategy

### Immediate Actions (Before Epic 2.2)
1. **Architect**: Implement CommandExecutor interface (cross-platform reliability)
2. **Architect**: Standardize error handling patterns across services
3. **Dev**: Generalize command execution framework for MCP activation

### Development Approach
- Address HIGH priority items in Epic 2.2 story development
- Integrate MEDIUM priority items as Epic 2 progresses
- Maintain 60%+ test coverage throughout Epic 2

### Success Metrics
- **Technical**: Zero Epic 2.2 blockers from infrastructure issues
- **Quality**: Consistent error handling across all Claude CLI operations
- **Platform**: Full Windows/Linux/macOS compatibility maintained
- **Architecture**: Service layer patterns remain consistent and extensible

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All learning items validated for actionability
- [x] Priority assigned based on Epic 2 development impact
- [x] Clear ownership for each item (architect/dev)
- [x] Specific timelines aligned with Epic 2 roadmap
- [x] Ready for technical planning integration
- [x] Epic 2.2 readiness criteria identified
- [x] Consensus achieved on priority decisions

## Integration Notes

**For commit-and-prepare-pr task**: These learning items represent the technical debt and architecture improvements that should be tracked and addressed as Epic 2 progresses. The HIGH priority items are essential for Epic 2.2 success.

**For Epic 2 planning**: The validated learning items provide a clear technical roadmap for maintaining architecture quality while delivering Epic 2 functionality.
