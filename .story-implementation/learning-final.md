## Implementation Strategy

### Sprint 1 (Next 3-5 days)
1. **TD-003** - Complete search functionality (Days 1-2)
2. **TD-001** - Replace hardcoded data with JSON storage (Days 2-4)
3. **Parallel Development** - Both items can be developed simultaneously

### Epic 1 Completion (Days 5-10)
1. **AI-001** - State management enhancement
2. **FW-001** - Basic accessibility features
3. **FW-003** - Performance monitoring baseline

### Risk Mitigation
- **Buffer Time:** 20% added to all estimates
- **Parallel Tracks:** TD-001 and TD-003 can be developed concurrently
- **MVP Scope:** Clear fallback options if timeline pressure occurs
- **Quality Gates:** All HIGH priority items require QA sign-off

## Collaborative Consensus Notes

### Agent Perspectives Integrated:

**Sarah (PO):** Emphasized business value of accessibility and search functionality  
**Bob (SM):** Advocated for realistic timelines and risk mitigation strategies  
**James (Dev):** Provided technical effort estimates and implementation approaches  
**Sally (UX):** Highlighted user impact of search and accessibility improvements  
**Winston (Architect):** Balanced technical debt with strategic architecture evolution  

### Key Decisions:
1. **Search Logic** elevated to HIGH - directly impacts daily user workflow
2. **Accessibility** elevated to MEDIUM - low effort, high impact for inclusivity
3. **Component Architecture** downgraded - incremental evolution preferred
4. **Performance Monitoring** elevated - proactive quality improvement

## Success Metrics

### For HIGH Priority Items:
- TD-001: JSON storage functional, real MCP data loading
- TD-003: Search filtering working, results highlighting active

### For MEDIUM Priority Items:
- AI-001: Complex state transitions handled cleanly
- FW-001: Basic screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation enhanced
- FW-003: Performance metrics collection baseline established
