# Technical Decisions Needed - Epic 1 Story 1

## Critical Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Data Integration Strategy
- **Decision:** How to replace hardcoded placeholder data with real MCP inventory data
- **Options:** 
  - "Direct file system integration" 
  - "Configuration-based data loading"
  - "Dynamic MCP discovery service"
- **Criteria:** Performance impact, maintainability, extensibility
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Blocking:** Yes - prevents production deployment

### Decision 2: Search Implementation Approach
- **Decision:** Complete search functionality implementation strategy
- **Options:**
  - "Real-time filtering with state management"
  - "Debounced search with async updates" 
  - "Simple string matching with immediate results"
- **Criteria:** User experience responsiveness, implementation complexity
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Blocking:** Yes - Tab key functionality incomplete

## Process Decisions

### Decision 3: UX Review Completion
- **Decision:** Whether to proceed without completed UX review
- **Options:**
  - "Complete UX review before merge"
  - "Merge with UX review as follow-up"
  - "Request expedited UX review"
- **Criteria:** Release timeline, quality standards, risk tolerance
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Blocking:** Potentially - depends on team policy

## Architecture Improvements

### Decision 4: State Management Enhancement
- **Decision:** Implementation of AI-001 state management enhancement
- **Options:**
  - "Centralized state store pattern"
  - "Component-local state with context"
  - "Event-driven state updates"
- **Criteria:** Scalability, testability, complexity
- **Priority:** HIGH (from story technical debt)
- **Blocking:** No - but impacts future stories

## Constraints Discovered

### Constraint 1: Terminal Environment Compatibility
- **Constraint:** Must maintain compatibility across macOS, Linux, Windows terminals
- **Impact:** Limits certain terminal-specific optimizations
- **Priority:** HIGH

### Constraint 2: Bubble Tea Framework Patterns
- **Constraint:** Must follow Bubble Tea model/view/update pattern consistently
- **Impact:** Restricts state management approaches
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

### Constraint 3: Performance Requirements
- **Constraint:** Application must load within 2 seconds (from AC1)
- **Impact:** Affects data loading and initialization strategies
- **Priority:** HIGH
