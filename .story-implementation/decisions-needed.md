# Technical Decisions Needed - Epic 2, Story 2

## Consolidation Summary

**Date:** 2025-07-02  
**Story:** Epic 2, Story 2 - MCP Activation Toggle with Enhanced Error Handling  
**Reviews Analyzed:** 5 (Architecture, Business, Process, QA, UX)  
**Decision Status:** All architectural and technical decisions validated by reviews

## Technical Decisions Required

**Result:** NONE REQUIRED

All critical technical decisions have been validated through the review process:

### Decisions Validated and Approved

1. **Error Classification System**
   - **Decision Made:** Use structured error types (CLAUDE_UNAVAILABLE, NETWORK_TIMEOUT, PERMISSION_ERROR, UNKNOWN_ERROR)
   - **Status:** ✅ Approved by Architecture Review (88%)
   - **Implementation:** Proceed as designed

2. **Retry Logic Approach**  
   - **Decision Made:** Single automatic retry for network timeouts only
   - **Status:** ✅ Approved by Business Review (92%)
   - **Implementation:** Proceed as designed

3. **UI State Management Pattern**
   - **Decision Made:** Extend existing Model struct with loading states (TOGGLE_LOADING, TOGGLE_SUCCESS, TOGGLE_ERROR, TOGGLE_RETRYING)
   - **Status:** ✅ Approved by UX Review (89%)
   - **Implementation:** Proceed as designed

4. **Status Bar Integration Approach**
   - **Decision Made:** Real-time operation feedback with error message display
   - **Status:** ✅ Approved by UX Review (89%)
   - **Implementation:** Proceed as designed

5. **Timeout Configuration**
   - **Decision Made:** 10-second operation timeout with 20-second total window including retry
   - **Status:** ✅ Approved by QA Review (91%)
   - **Implementation:** Proceed as designed

6. **Service Integration Pattern**
   - **Decision Made:** Extend existing ClaudeService with ToggleMCPStatus method returning ToggleResult struct
   - **Status:** ✅ Approved by Architecture Review (88%)
   - **Implementation:** Proceed as designed

## Future Decision Points (Post-MVP)

The following decisions are explicitly deferred to future iterations per MVP scope:

1. **Advanced Retry Strategies** - Deferred to Epic 2.3+
2. **Comprehensive Error Analytics** - Deferred to Epic 2.3+
3. **Enhanced Progress Indicators** - Deferred to Epic 2.3+

## Implementation Guidance

**All architectural and technical decisions have been validated.** Proceed with implementation as designed in the story specification.

**No blocking decisions require resolution before implementation can begin.**

## Constraints Discovered

Based on review feedback analysis:

### Technical Constraints Confirmed

1. **Claude CLI Dependency**
   - **Constraint:** Must validate Claude CLI availability before operations
   - **Impact:** No operations possible without Claude CLI
   - **Mitigation:** Implemented in Story 2.1 foundation

2. **MVP Scope Boundary**
   - **Constraint:** Single retry maximum per MVP scope
   - **Impact:** Cannot implement advanced retry strategies in this iteration
   - **Mitigation:** Accepted as MVP limitation

3. **Existing Service Pattern Compliance**
   - **Constraint:** Must integrate with established Claude service architecture from Story 2.1
   - **Impact:** Implementation approach is constrained by existing patterns
   - **Mitigation:** Leverages proven foundation

4. **Performance Requirements**
   - **Constraint:** 10-second operation timeout enforcement
   - **Impact:** Must ensure all operations complete within timeout
   - **Mitigation:** Built into design specifications

**Status:** ✅ ALL DECISIONS VALIDATED - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
