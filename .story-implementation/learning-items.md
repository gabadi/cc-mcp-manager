# Learning Triage - Epic 1, Story 3: Add MCP Workflow

**Generated:** 2025-06-30  
**Workflow Step:** 17 - learning_triage  
**Agent:** architect
**Source:** Implementation experience and validation results analysis

## Executive Summary

Analysis of the Epic 1, Story 3 implementation reveals significant technical debt and architecture improvement opportunities. Despite achieving 85.9% service layer coverage and comprehensive architecture documentation, the integration between UI components and the underlying system shows clear gaps requiring immediate attention.

## Technical Debt Items

### 1. Integration Test Alignment Gap
- **Item:** Integration tests failing due to behavior discrepancies
- **Location:** `internal/integration_test.go` - 7/7 tests failing
- **Impact:** Cannot validate complete user workflows, blocking story completion
- **Action:** Align integration test expectations with actual system behavior or fix system behavior to match test expectations
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Category:** URGENT_FIX

### 2. UI Component Coverage Disparity
- **Item:** UI layer showing 34.7% coverage vs 85.9% service coverage
- **Location:** `internal/ui/components/` and `internal/ui/handlers/`
- **Impact:** Insufficient validation of user interaction paths
- **Action:** Add comprehensive UI component and handler test coverage
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Category:** TECHNICAL_DEBT

### 3. Text Rendering Inconsistencies
- **Item:** Footer and Grid components failing due to text rendering differences
- **Location:** `internal/ui/components/footer_test.go` and `grid_test.go`
- **Impact:** Component tests unreliable, may indicate actual display issues
- **Action:** Standardize text rendering expectations and fix component output consistency
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Category:** TECHNICAL_DEBT

### 4. Modal System Architecture Gap
- **Item:** Modal implementation missing from current codebase
- **Location:** Story 3 AC requirements vs actual implementation
- **Impact:** Core story functionality (Add MCP workflow) cannot be completed
- **Action:** Implement complete modal system with state management as specified in story ACs
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Category:** ARCH_CHANGE

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. State Management Consistency
- **Pattern:** Integration between UI state and service layer
- **Current Issue:** Test failures indicate state updates not propagating correctly
- **Benefit:** Reliable user interaction workflows
- **Action:** Implement centralized state management pattern with proper update propagation
- **Category:** ARCH_CHANGE

### 2. Component Testing Strategy
- **Pattern:** UI component validation approach
- **Current Issue:** Mixed success rates in component tests (37% coverage)
- **Benefit:** Reliable UI behavior validation
- **Action:** Establish standardized component testing patterns with consistent mocking
- **Category:** PROCESS_IMPROVEMENT

### 3. Integration Testing Framework
- **Pattern:** End-to-end workflow validation
- **Current Issue:** Integration tests written against expected vs actual behavior
- **Benefit:** Validation of complete user scenarios
- **Action:** Create integration test framework that validates actual system behavior
- **Category:** TOOLING

## Future Work Items

### 1. Comprehensive Modal System Implementation
- **Work:** Complete modal system architecture from Story 3 specifications
- **Problem:** Current implementation lacks modal state management and form handling
- **Solution:** Implement TD-001 through TD-006 technical decisions from story specification
- **Timeline:** Next sprint - blocks story completion
- **Category:** FUTURE_EPIC

### 2. TUI Framework Optimization
- **Work:** Performance optimization for Bubble Tea integration
- **Problem:** Integration tests suggest potential performance issues in UI updates
- **Solution:** Implement efficient state update patterns and reduce unnecessary renders
- **Timeline:** Next epic - quality improvement
- **Category:** ARCH_CHANGE

### 3. Test Infrastructure Standardization
- **Work:** Unified testing approach across all layers
- **Problem:** Different testing patterns between services (85.9% coverage) and UI (34.7% coverage)
- **Solution:** Establish consistent testing standards and tooling across all components
- **Timeline:** Next sprint - quality foundation
- **Category:** PROCESS_IMPROVEMENT

### 4. Error Handling Framework
- **Work:** Comprehensive error handling and recovery system
- **Problem:** Integration tests reveal gaps in error scenarios
- **Solution:** Implement structured error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Timeline:** Next epic - user experience improvement
- **Category:** ARCH_CHANGE
