## Technical Debt Analysis

### Identified Technical Debt

#### TD-001: Hardcoded Placeholder Data
**Priority:** Medium  
**Location:** `/Users/2-gabadi/workspace/ai/cc-mcp-manager/internal/ui/model.go:67-72`  
**Description:** MCP items are hardcoded in the NewModel() function rather than loaded from configuration.  
**Technical Impact:** Data coupling, testing limitations, configuration inflexibility  
**Remediation:** Create configuration-driven MCP inventory loader  
**Effort:** 2-3 days  
**Dependencies:** Configuration system (Future Epic)

#### TD-002: Mock Data in Details Column
**Priority:** Low  
**Location:** `/Users/2-gabadi/workspace/ai/cc-mcp-manager/internal/ui/view.go:225-242`  
**Description:** Details column renders placeholder information instead of actual MCP metadata.  
**Technical Impact:** Limited production value, user confusion  
**Remediation:** Implement actual MCP introspection and metadata display  
**Effort:** 1-2 days  
**Dependencies:** MCP protocol integration (Epic 2)

#### TD-003: Search Logic Incomplete
**Priority:** Medium  
**Location:** `/Users/2-gabadi/workspace/ai/cc-mcp-manager/internal/ui/update.go:106-124`  
**Description:** Search mode captures input but doesn't implement actual filtering logic.  
**Technical Impact:** Non-functional feature, user experience gap  
**Remediation:** Implement MCP filtering and search result handling  
**Effort:** 1-2 days  
**Dependencies:** None

## Architecture Improvements

### AI-001: State Management Enhancement
**Priority:** High  
**Rationale:** Current flat state model will become complex as features expand  
**Recommendation:** Implement hierarchical state machine with context-aware transitions  
**Benefits:**
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing of state transitions  
- Reduced cognitive complexity for future developers
- Enhanced debugging capabilities

**Implementation Approach:**
```go
type AppContext struct {
    Navigation NavigationState
    Search     SearchState
    Modal      ModalState
    Config     ConfigState
}
```

**Timeline:** Epic 2 preparation phase  
**Risk:** Medium - requires refactoring existing state logic

### AI-002: Component Architecture Pattern
**Priority:** Medium  
**Rationale:** View rendering logic is becoming monolithic as features grow  
**Recommendation:** Extract reusable component system following Bubble Tea patterns  
**Benefits:**
- Improved code reusability
- Easier testing of individual components
- Better maintainability
- Consistent UI patterns across features

**Implementation Approach:**
```go
type Component interface {
    Update(tea.Msg) (Component, tea.Cmd)
    View() string
    Focus() Component
    Blur() Component
}
```

**Timeline:** Epic 1, Story 2-3 timeframe  
**Risk:** Low - additive change that enhances existing architecture

### AI-003: Layout System Abstraction
**Priority:** Medium  
**Rationale:** Responsive layout logic is embedded in view code, limiting extensibility  
**Recommendation:** Create dedicated layout management system  
**Benefits:**
- Dynamic layout configuration
- Easier testing of responsive behavior
- Support for future layout variations
- Better separation of presentation logic

**Implementation Approach:**
```go
type LayoutManager interface {
    CalculateLayout(width, height int) Layout
    AdaptLayout(Layout, []Component) RenderedLayout
}
```

**Timeline:** Mid Epic 1 (Stories 3-4)  
**Risk:** Medium - impacts view rendering logic
